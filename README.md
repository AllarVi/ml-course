## Practice 6 

1) Generate dataset where some features are linearly dependant and some not.

2) Fit the dataset to fitlm (linear regression)

3) Look at "mdl.Coefficients"

4) Look at "tStat" (test statistic) to find which variables are significant

0 in pValue means "perfect" model

5) The "Estimate" column corresponds to

50
10

y = 50x1 + 10x2 ...

* small tStat and pValue indicate insignificant variables 

5) Look at "mdl.Rsquared" 

High numbers indicate how good the model is and that there is not much noise

H0 (null hypothesis) is what we want to reject.
